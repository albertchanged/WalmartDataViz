# WalmartDataViz

This is a React and D3.js-based data visualization tool using Walmart Open API!

## Check it out [here](https://albertchanged.github.io/WalmartDataViz)!

### How It Works

Upon user input (searching for products), this application performs an AJAX call via Walmart's Search API to retrieve the Top 10 Bestselling ones on Walmart.com, and displays it in a horizontal bar chart (Bestselling Rank vs. Product Price). You may also hover over/click on the bars to see the full product name and prices.

Technologies used: React JS, Redux, D3.js, Webpack, Walmart Open API, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
